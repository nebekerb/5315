      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a container. Every application on a machine takes up resources. When many applications are fighting for the same resources it can create problems. While you could purchase a virtual machine for each application, it would get very expensive. A container such as Docker partitions the operating system's resources into separate little environments creating containers instead of a free-for-all frenzy on resources. Containers also provide the ability to scale and move things much easier. Changes can be made and upgrades implemented without disturbing the other containers and operating system as a whole.

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>Nginx is an open source web server which more than 358 million websites rely on such as Netflix and Dropbox. It was developed by Igor Sysoev in 2002 and released in 2004. Nginx uses event based processing in which it utilizes Worker Connections and Worker Processes. The Worker Connections handle the request and responses and simultaneously requests pass through the Worker Process. It's a bit confusing at first but allows for a ridiculous number of connections. For example, one Worker Connection can have 1,024 connections at once. There can be as many Worker Processes as one can setup on the server. Unique requests are transfered on to the Nginx Master Processor. It is all done asynchronously. This was all developed to over come the C10K issue which was basically servers being unable to scale above 10,000 connections due to a lack of resources.

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine (VM) is a file, called an image, on a computer. Similar to how Docker partitions the operating system's resources, a VM runs on partitioned hardware resources that are mapped to physical hardware. You can have multiple VMs on a computer without them ever interacting with eachother because they are sandboxed in that they cannot leave or interfer with the physical computer. VMs run in their own window similar to a program. To sum it up, a VM is a software computer running on a physical computer separate from other running software.

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>Digitalocean is a virtual hosting provider. Back in the day, in order to provide a web service such as a simple company website, the company would need to purchase a physical server, pay for a reliable interenet connection that could handle the bandwidth of all the visitors, and host everything onsite. Virtual hosting provides web services for those that don't want the hassle of setting up and maintaining physical servers. Digitalocean provides what are called droplets, their name for a Virtual Private Server. They're the 3rd largest in the world providing droplets, managed databases, simple object storage, Kubernetes, load balancers, block storage, and marketplace pre-built applications.
