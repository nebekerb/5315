      <h2>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Git is a superior distributed Version Control System that takes snapshots that, unlike other VCSs that store data as changes to a set model version file, act as stream of snapshots of an entire project over a time period storing them in a local database. But for any of this to make sense you need to know what a VCS is. If you have ever worked in on a group project using Google Docs then you know how valuable the Version History feature is in which you can see the changes that were made over time and by whom. Software developers work in teams and using the Google Doc analogy sometimes things go wrong and you have to go back to an earlier version. A VCS acts as a type of Version History or more plainly a backup. It is possible to develop software without a VCS just as it is to write a group paper without a Version History but it isn't very smart because one mistake can drastically impact everyone on the team.

      <h2>Describe local repo</h2>
      <p>Local repo means local repository. It is on the local computer hence the "local" and has all files and commit history, which provides commiting and history review offline. As mentioned earlier, Git is a distributed VCS meaning that everyone on the team doesn't need to rely on only a central repository.

      <h2>Describe remote repo</h2>
      <p>Remote repo is short for remote repository. Git uses remote repo as the source for the central server for the codebase. It's the repository that everyone on the team is connected to and pushes commits to from their local repo.
